        We usually train twice a week on Thursday evenings and Sunday mornings
        unless we have a game to play on Sunday in which case we will only
        practice on Thursday. We are an understanding society when it comes to
        missing the occasional training session, but we ask all our members
        to attend as often as possible.
        We also maitain a strength and conditioning regimen that includes
        session at Ethos with our gym coach. All players are expected to take
        part in these sessions are more than encouraged to hit the gym on their
        time. This is especially important as it helps prevent injuries and
        accelerates player development.

        As you may know, American football requires a lot of equipement. The
        most important safety pieces are helmets, shoulder pads and leg
        protections, which are all provided by the club to its members. However,
        gum-shields and cleated boots are also required and should you should
        purchase them individually, but don't worry they can be bought for less
        than 30Â£. Furthermore, gloves are also recommended but
        these can be bought in bulk as part of larger team purchase that happens
        at the beginning of the season.
