      American Football is a fast, hard-hitting and exciting game ever growing
      in popularity. Established in 2006, the Imperial Immortals American
      Football Club has rapidly grown as an upcoming team in the BUCS league,
      previously reaching the National Semi-Finals and currently playing in the
      BUCS Division 1A South East. Fixtures are played on Sunday afternoons,
      with training usually once/twice a week with coaches. We have dedicated
      coaching  staff with more than three decades of playing experience between
      them to help you become a better football player.

      For those looking for a competitive team sport, look no further.  The club
      welcomes players of all abilities and sporting backgrounds, and encourage
      anyone who is interested to give American Football a go at our Come and
      Try Sessions in early October. However, it is never too late to give it a
      try- we recruit throughout the year. With so many positions within the
      team, there is bound to be one that suits you. For those looking to
      compete at a high level, this sport offers the perfect opportunity in BUCS
      as well as the chance to play for the Great Britain University Squad!
