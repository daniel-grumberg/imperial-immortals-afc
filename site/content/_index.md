    Despite the name, American Football is played all the over the world.
    Attending university in the United Kingdom is a great opportunity to pick up
    this wonderful sport. We get to enjoy one of the most developed university
    leagues outside the United States. We provide a an amazing environment for
    new comers to start playing the game. Our team is tight-nit and beyond
    getting to play and compete, you will make lifelong friends joining the
    team.
